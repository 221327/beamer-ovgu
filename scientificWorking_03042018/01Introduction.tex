\textbf{Scientific working is a social discipline that includes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Having great ideas
\item Actually doing own research and science
\item Working in the teams
\item Raising money
\item Publishing papers
\item Giving presentations
\item Evaluating others people work
\end{itemize}
\textbf{This class will streghten your skills in}
\begin{itemize}
\item Giving presentations on scientific topics
\item Working in the teams
\item Evaluating others people work
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Scientists are evaluated based on their publications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Measurement of quality of publication is a impact factor of the journal (IF)
\item One needs to compare journal impact factors within particular field
\item Medical and economical journals tend to have higher impact factors
\item Better journals have more stricter quality standards
\item Higher impacted journals = higher rejection rate (i.e. 70\%)
\item Well established per-rewiew process
\item Experts in the field evaluates work of the scientists
\item \textbf{Accept, change, reject}
\end{itemize}
